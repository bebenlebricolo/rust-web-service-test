# rust-web-service-test
A test webservice using Rust to handle Http requests

This small repository was intended to try out Rust Swagger documentation features using the [Utoipa](https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa) crate.
For now it is based around the [rocket 0.4 example](https://github.com/juhaku/utoipa/tree/master/examples/rocket-0_4-hello).
